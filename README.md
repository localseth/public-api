# Connect to and Use a Public API
Project for unit 8 of the Treehouse WebDev Techdegree

### Use Fetch to Access and Parse Data
For this project, I used the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) to gather and generate sample employee data to a webpage. I utilized the `fetch` API in JavaScript to submit a request for data from the server and then handled that data all in JavaScript.

### Search Feature
The search box will display only employees that match the search results. This happens as the user types, but there is a search button as well.

### Overlay navigation
Once a user is clicked, an overlay appears with more data on that user. A 'close' button exits the overlay and navigation buttons allow you to move to the next or previous entry displayed on the webpage. If you navigate previous from the first entry, you are taken to the last entry. If you navigate next from the last entry, you are taken to the first entry.

### Notes
I wrote all of the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for this project. Treehouse supplied mockups as a guide and library of resources included videos, practice projects, and more.
